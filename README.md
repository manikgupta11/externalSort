# C++ implementation of External Sort

* External Sorting is a class of algorithms used to deal with massive amounts of data that do not fit in memory

* Using external sort, we can sort files larger than the system memory

* It uses K-Way merge algorithm  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm

Execution Format:
```
g++ externalSort.cpp
./a.out <input_file> <output_file>
```
